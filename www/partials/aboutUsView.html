    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Bright Beginnings leads the design, delivery, and evaluation of
        innovative programs to promote the healthy development of children
        in the first 3 years of life.
    </p>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
        To provide a bright beginning for all Colorado children by helping families
        and caregivers support their children's physical, emotional and intellectual
        development during the critical first three years of life.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Colorado Bright Beginnings is a statewide nonprofit organization that
        unleashes the power of parenting for all parents, soon to be parents and
        caregivers of infants and toddlers.
    </p>
    <p>
        We offer parenting education and support through individualized,
        interactive dialogue with highly trained volunteers and community
        partners in three ways: home, group and agency visits. Our research
        based information, guides and games designed to be used every day,
        provide answers to questions and concerns that parents often don't even know to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because 85% of brain development occurs in the first 3 years of
        life and because babies don't come with instruction manuals,
        we share these vital resources to help all parents feel more
        confident and to help build a nurturing and learning relationship
        with their child, creating the best chance for success in school
        and life while creating healthier Colorado communities.
    </p>
