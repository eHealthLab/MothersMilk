    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Mothers’ Milk Messaging (M3) is a texting breastfeeding support
        intervention aimed at increasing exclusive and continuous breastfeeding,
        providing helpful links to online resources.
    </p>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
        To adapt and program a bilingual English-Spanish tailored texting
        message program to support exclusive and continuous breastfeeding
        starting in pregnancy with the intent to breastfeed and continuing
        postpartum. At the same time, we hope to create a valuable resource
        for sharing information and social support connecting new mothers
        through Facebook.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mothers’ Milk Messaging (MMM) is newly developed program with content
        based on published work by Dr. Maya Bunik, pediatrician, breastfeeding
        expert and author of Breastfeeding Telephone Triage and Advice book.
        Targeted outcomes are maternal satisfaction with achieving feeding
        goals and rates of exclusive breastfeeding and duration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Breastfeeding prevents an array of chronic illness for both mother
        (breast and ovarian cancer) and baby (respiratory and gastrointestinal
        infections, diabetes, intestinal disease, necrotizing enterocolitis,
        allergies, asthma, obesity and cancer) We hope to decrease mother’s
        choosing formula by providing encouragement and useful information
        during the critical period when milk supply is established.
